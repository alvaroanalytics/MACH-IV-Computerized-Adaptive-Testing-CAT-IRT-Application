# MACH-IV: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) IRT Application

This web application implements a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) for the Mach-IV scale. By dynamically selecting items based on the user's previous responses, the algorithm maximizes measurement precision while significantly reducing test length: providing real-time scoring and trait estimation of the user's Machiavellian orientation.

You can execute this application directly from your RStudio console without manually downloading files. The code includes an auto-installation script for required packages.

### Option 1: The "Magic Command" (Recommended)
Run the following command in your RStudio Console:

```r
shiny::runGitHub("MACH-IV-Computerized-Adaptive-Testing-CAT-IRT-Application", "alvaroanalytics")
```
