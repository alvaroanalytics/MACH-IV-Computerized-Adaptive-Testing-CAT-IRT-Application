# MACH-IV-Computerized-Adaptive-Testing-CAT-IRT-Application
This web application implements a Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) for the Mach-IV scale. By dynamically selecting items based on the user's previous responses, the algorithm maximizes measurement precision while significantly reducing test length: providing real-time scoring and trait estimation of the user's Machiavellian orientation.
